--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[35888,0],0] on node s03r2b25
  Remote daemon: [[35888,0],31] on node s22r1b37

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.

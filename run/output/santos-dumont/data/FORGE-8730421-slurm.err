slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 8730421 ON s06r1b16 CANCELLED AT 2020-02-07T13:43:24 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[26789,0],0] on node s06r1b16
  Remote daemon: [[26789,0],9] on node s06r1b42

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.

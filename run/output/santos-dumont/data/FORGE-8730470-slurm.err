slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 8730470 ON s13r1b68 CANCELLED AT 2020-02-07T08:19:52 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[63375,0],0] on node s13r1b68
  Remote daemon: [[63375,0],1] on node s13r1b70

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.

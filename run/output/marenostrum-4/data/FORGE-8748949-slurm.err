A hostfile was provided that contains multiple definitions
of the slot count for at least one node:

  hostfile:  /home/bsc03/bsc03353/FORGE-experiments-read/FORGE-929-8748949/nodes
  node:      s13r2b10

You can either list a node multiple times, once for each slot,
or you can provide a single line that contains "slot=N". Mixing
the two methods is not supported.

Please correct the hostfile and try again.

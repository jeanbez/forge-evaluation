slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 8730507 ON s08r1b02 CANCELLED AT 2020-02-07T14:24:07 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[52584,0],0] on node s08r1b02
  Remote daemon: [[52584,0],5] on node s21r2b05

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.

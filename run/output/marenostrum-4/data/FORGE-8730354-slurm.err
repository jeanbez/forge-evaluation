slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 8730354 ON s11r1b34 CANCELLED AT 2020-02-07T12:44:42 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[54644,0],0] on node s11r1b34
  Remote daemon: [[54644,0],1] on node s11r1b38

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.

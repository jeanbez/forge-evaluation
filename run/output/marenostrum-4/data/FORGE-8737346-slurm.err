--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[1729,0],0] on node s02r1b05
  Remote daemon: [[1729,0],1] on node s02r1b06

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.

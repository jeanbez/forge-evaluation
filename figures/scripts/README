# I/O Forwarding Explorer - Figures (script)

In this directory, you can find the scripts used to generate the plots of our paper:

- `figure-2.Rmd`
- `figure-3-a.Rmd`
- `figure-3-b.Rmd`
- `figure-4.Rmd`

These files were generated with R (RStudio). Each file will load the CSV files, execute our analysis, and create the PDF plots embedded in our paper. If you want to customize FORGE's installation by enabling or disabling any additional modules, please refer to FORGE's repository for the detailed documentation.

You will also find an additional file:

- `figure-2-complete.Rmd`

This file generated a larger plot with all the 189 access patterns we tested on MareNostrum 4, which was not included in the paper due to its size.
